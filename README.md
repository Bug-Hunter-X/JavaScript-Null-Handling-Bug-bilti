This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to null handling.  The `bug.js` file showcases a function that doesn't explicitly check for null values, leading to potential errors. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to correctly handle null inputs to prevent unexpected behavior.  See the files for code examples.
